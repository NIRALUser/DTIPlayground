# DTI Playground 

DTI Playground are python based NIRAL pipeline software including DMRIPrep (dmriprep), DTIAtlasBuilder (dmriatlasbuilder), DTIFiberAnalyzer (dmrifiberanalyzer), AutoTract

## DMRIPrep (dmriprep)

dmriprep is a tool that performs quality control over diffusion weighted images. Quality control is very essential preprocess in DTI research, in which the bad gradients with artifacts are to be excluded or corrected by using various computational methods. The software and library provides a module based package with which users can make his own QC pipeline as well as new pipeline modules.

#### Installation (Mac/Linux/Windows-WSL)

We recommend users to make a virtual environment first using python >= 3.8.6

```
$ python -m venv $HOME/dtiplayground-env
$ source $HOME/dtiplayground-env/bin/activate
(dtiplayground_env) $ pip install dtiplayground
$ dmriprep -v
```

For Windows users, install WSL and linux distribution (tested with ubuntu 20.04, Centos7).
**FSL should be installed and environment variable 'FSL' needs to be set to the corresponding directory before initialization.**

**install-tools** - Install DTIPlayground Tools (docker & docker-compose required)

**Note** : Build tested only on CentOS7 for now. However, it would work on most of linux systems. You don't need to install this tools everytime you upgrade dtiplayground.
```
$ dmriprep install-tools [-o <output directory>] [--clean-install] [--no-remove] [--nofsl] [--install-only]
```
Default output directory is `$HOME/.niral-dti/dtiplayground-tools` if output directory option is omitted
- If `--clean-install` option is present, it removes existing software packages and temporary files first.
- If `--no-remove` option is present, it doesn't remove temporary build files after installation
- If `--nofsl` option is present, it will not install FSL.
- If `--install-only` option is present, it will not update software path file of the configuration of the current version.

Once installed, `$HOME/.niral-dti/global_variables.yml` will have information of the tools including root path of the packages, and automatically changes software paths for the current version of dmriprep unless `--install-only` option is present.

**NOTE** Once FSL is installed, some of tools in FSL has hard coded path in the script, which means that once FSL directory is moved or copied to different directory, some of functions will not work (e.g. eddy_quad). You need to re-install FSL in that case. But changing directory of FSL doesn't affect the functions of DTIPlayground so far. 

#### GUI Mode (Mac/Linux):

When a user run dmriprep-ui first time, it automatically initialize.
```
$ dmriprep-ui
```

#### CLI Mode (Mac/Linux/Windows-WSL):

For windows users, install WSL2 and linux packages with python >=3.8.6. 

1. **init** - Initialize configuration (default: `$HOME/.niral-dti/dmriprep-<version>`)

**init** command generates the configuration directory and files with following command. One just needs to execute this command only once unless a different configuration is needed. If you want to reset the initial configuration directory, you can run init again.
```
    $ dmriprep init 
```
If you want to set different directory other than default one :
```
    $ dmriprep --config-dir my/config/dir init 
```
Once run, `config.yml` and `environment.yml` will be in the directory. 

You can manually specify the tool directory (which is generated by `install-tools` command) by `--tools-dir` option.
```
    $ dmriprep init --tools-dir <path/to/tool_dir>
```

2. **update** - Update if `config.yml` has been changed (e.g. in case of adding user module directory).
Changing `config.yml` file should be followed by updating `environment.yml` with running update command :
```
    $ dmriprep [--config-dir my/config/dir] update
```
This will update module-specific informations such as binary locations or package location used by the corresponding module. It simply updates `environment.yml`

3. **make-protocols** - Generating a default protocol file

The first thing to do QC is to generate default protocol file that has pipeline information.
```
    $ dmriprep [base options] make-protocols -i IMAGE_FILENAME [-o OUTPUT_FILENAME_] [-d MODULE1 MODULE2 ... ]
```
if `-o` option is omitted, the output protocol will be printed on terminal.`-d` option specifies the list of modules for the QC, with which command will generate the default pipeline and protocols of the sequence. Same module can be used redundantly. If `-d` option is not specified, the default pipeline will be generated from the file `protocol_template.yml` . You can change the default pipeline in `protocol_template.yml` file

4. **run** - Running pipeline 
To run with default protocol generated from `protocol_template.yml`:

```
    $ dmriprep [base options] run -i IMAGE_FILES -o OUTPUT_DIR -d [ MODULE1 MODULE2 ... ]
```
`-d` option (default protocol) works as described in **make-protocols** command. But you need to specify `"-d"` for the default pipeline from the template.  If `-o` option is omitted, default directory will be set to `Image filename_QC`. IMAGE_FILES may be a list of files to process. In case of susceptibility correction, IMAGE_FILES needs to have counterparts for the polarities. `dmriprep` automatically process qc for all the input images before the susceptibility correction stage.

To run with existing protocol file:
```
    $ dmriprep run -i IMAGE_FILES -p PROTOCOL_FILE -o output/directory/
```

`-p` option cannot be used with `-d` option.

#### In SLURM cluster with singularity

`dmriprep_slurm` is a wrapper script for dmriprep under singularity container. Usage is same. Users can change slurm resource parameter in the script.
```
    $ dmriprep_slurm <<same options as dmriprep>>
```

### Development of a new module

#### Adding a module

Once initialized, users can add their custom module from scratch or existing system/user modules by following command
```
$ dmriprep add-module <module-name> [--base-module <base-module-name>] [--edit]
```
Following command will generate initial skeletal files of module
```
$ dmriprep add-module HELLO_World 
```
Then you can test if the module can be loaded properly with
```
$ dmriprep update
```
You can use your module right in protocol file.

if `-b` , `--base-module` is specified, new model will copy existing code and data from the base module.
e.g.
```
$ dmriprep add-module MYFIRST_Module -b SLICE_Check
```
MYFIRST_Module will have same codes and data (module definition yaml file) from SLICE_Check module with new classname and filenames.

#### Removing user module
User module can be removed by
```
$ dmriprep remove-module <module-name>
```
e.g.
```
$ dmriprep remove-module MYFIRST_Module
```

**NOTE** System module cannot be removed by this command. Only user module can be removed.

#### Modules in other directory
You can just copy module directory to `$HOME/.niral-dti/modules/dmriprep` and check with `$ dmriprep update` command. Same applies for removal of user modules.

### Supported Images

- NRRD 
- NIFTI

## DTIAtlasBuilder (dtiab)

DTIAtlasBuilder is a software to make an atlas from multiple diffusion weighted images. It performs affine/diffeomorphic registrations and finally generates the atlas for all the reference image. 

## DTIFiberAnalyzer (dtifa)

DTIFiberAnalyzer performs statistical computation over the extracted fibers. This enables researchers to get the information of the fiber images easily and fast.
