### BASELINE_Average

##### Introduction

BASELINE_Average.py will average the baseline scans of a subject. The baseline scans are defined as the first scans of each session. The baseline scans are averaged and saved as a new baseline scan. The new baseline scan is saved in the same directory as the original baseline scan
